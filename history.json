Her real name is never mentioned.\n*   **Her Origin:** She was the third of eleven children of a prosperous shopkeeper in old Caldas. The narrator refers to her as his \"fugitive compatriot\" from Quindio.\n*   **Her Talent:** From a young age, she had a talent for interpreting dreams, which she believed had \"oracular qualities.\"\n*   **Her Job:** During difficult winters in Vienna, she got a job with a family by telling them, \"I dream.\" Her only obligation was to interpret her dreams each morning at breakfast to \"decipher the family’s daily fate.\" Her predictions eventually became the \"sole authority in the house,\" and her control over the family was \"absolute.\"\n*   **Her Later Life:** The narrator meets her again years later when she is old and fat. She had sold her properties in Austria and retired to Oporto, Portugal, living in a house she describes as a \"fake castle on a hill.\"",

        "Based on the provided document, here are more elaborate details about Frau Frieda:\n\n*   **The Narrator's Perception of Her Talent:** The narrator was skeptical of her abilities, believing her dreams were not genuine prophecies but rather a \"stratagem for surviving.\"\n\n*   **How She Acquired Her Wealth:** The document makes it clear that her role with the Viennese family was more than just a job. It states that \"dream by dream, she had taken over the entire fortune of her ineffable patrons in Vienna.\" This implies a calculated use of her interpretations to gain financial control.\n\n*   **Her Connection to the Story's Main Events:** The narrator reconnected with her story when he \"heard about the snake ring on the woman who died in the Havana Riviera disaster.\" This links her directly to the dramatic wave incident mentioned at the beginning of the text.\n\n*   **An External Perspective on Her Profession:** The Portuguese ambassador, when asked what she did, replied with \"a certain disenchantment,\" saying, \"Nothing... She dreamed.\" This highlights the unusual and intangible nature of her life's work.\n\n*   **A Physical Description:** At one point, she is described as \"an intrepid woman in an old-fashioned felt hat and a purple scarf, eating without haste and staring at him.\"",
